#Music Maker

This project was inspired by a Dev Ed tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJlzeEVL8A.

During this project I learned about the "box-sizing: border-box" property and the "flex" property, adding an event listener for when the window loads, and about the currentTime property for audio elements.
